## Welcome!
My name is Robert Stapleton, and I will be periodically updating this repository with various projects to learn skills with the basic aspects of web development:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Big Thanks!
Oodles of credit towards Takuya Matsuyama from *devaslife* for the inspiring perspective of a solo, full-stack developer and Brad Traversy from *Traversy Media* for the abundance of quality training information!
